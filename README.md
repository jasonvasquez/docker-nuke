# docker-nuke

Nukes containers / images / volumes.   You really shouldn't trust this.
I'm a good guy, but you should really read the source :)


## Usage

The easiest way to run it, which will always use the latest production-ready version from the master branch:

```
curl -sL http://bit.ly/NukeDockerData | bash
```
